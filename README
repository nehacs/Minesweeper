Minesweeper

The files in this directory can be run in 2 ways:
1. Run minesweeper -- give it your own parameters on board size and number of mines and it will allow you to play the game.
2. Run the solver -- this creates 100,000 minesweeper random boards of a 10x10 size with 10 mines each and solves them.
